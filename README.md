## Task 01: Vector Addition

**Summary** :  
Implemented a simple kernel to add two vectors. Explored launching kernels, device memory management, data transfer between host and device and basic CUDA programming concepts.

---

## Task 02: Matrix Addition

**Summary** :  
Implemented a kernel to add two matrices. Learnt about barrier synchronisation, thread scheduling, hardware resource management (warps and stuff) and latency tolerance.

## Task 03: Matrix Vector Multiplication

**Summary** :
Implemented a kernel to multiply a matrix with a vector. Explored shared memory, thread cooperation and performance optimisations. 

## Task 04: Vector sum 

**Summary** :  
Implemented a kernel to compute the sum of all elements of a vector. Explored reduction techniques, and warp divergence and performance optimisations.
