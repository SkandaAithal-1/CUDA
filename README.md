## Task 01: Vector Addition

**Summary** :  
Implemented a simple kernel to add two vectors. Explored launching kernels, device memory management, data transfer between host and device and basic CUDA programming concepts.

## Task 02: Matrix Addition

**Summary** :  
Implemented a kernel to add two matrices. Learnt about barrier synchronisation, thread scheduling, hardware resource management (warps and stuff) and latency tolerance.
